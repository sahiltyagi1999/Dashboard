Finance Dashboard - MERN Stack with Real-Time Updates and Predictive Analytics

Description:

This repository provides the source code for a comprehensive finance dashboard application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The dashboard offers real-time financial data visualization, interactive charts, and insightful revenue predictions for the next year.

Features:

MERN Stack: Leverages the power and flexibility of the MERN stack for robust application development.
Real-Time Transaction Updates: Displays the 50 most recent transactions with automatic refresh to keep users informed of their latest financial activities.
Interactive Data Visualization: Employs a variety of over 5 different chart types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts) to provide clear and visually compelling insights into financial data.
Machine Learning-powered Revenue Prediction: Utilizes regression analysis to estimate next year's revenue, aiding in informed financial planning and decision-making. (Note: Accuracy of predictions may vary depending on the data and model training.)
